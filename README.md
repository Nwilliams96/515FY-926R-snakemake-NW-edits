# 515Y–926R eASV Snakemake pipeline

This workflow is in progress and is not yet ready for production use.

Use the [interactive pipeline tutorial and configuration builder](https://www.nathanlrwilliams.com/eASV-Pipeline-Tutorial/)
to prepare a study-specific setup package. The tutorial's HTTPS clone command
downloads the current version of this repository's `main` branch.

## Requirements

Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and
[Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/),
then create an isolated Snakemake controller environment following the
[official Snakemake installation guidance](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html):

```bash
conda create --name snakemake --channel conda-forge --channel bioconda snakemake
conda activate snakemake
snakemake --version
```

Run this workflow with `--use-conda`. The included launch scripts also pass a
shared `--conda-prefix`, taken from `conda_envs_dir` in `config/config.yml`.
Snakemake identifies rule environments from their environment definitions: it
reuses matching completed environments and creates only those that are missing
or whose definitions have changed. Keep this directory outside each analysis
clone so new projects can share the same QIIME 2, R, BLAST, BBMap, and utility
environments. For example:

```yaml
conda_envs_dir: "../eASV-conda-envs"
```

Set `SNAKEMAKE_CONDA_PREFIX` before running if a computer or HPC needs to
override that configured location. Older projects without `conda_envs_dir`
reuse their existing `.snakemake/conda` directory when present; otherwise the
scripts default to `../eASV-conda-envs`.

When internal-standard correction is enabled, `intstds` is an ordered list and
may contain one or more unique standard IDs:

```yaml
use_internal_standards: true
intstds:
  - "ISD_1"
  - "ISD_2"
```

Each ID requires a matching `<ID>_ng` column in `config/samples.tsv` and a
matching row in `config/internal_stds.tsv`. Older configs that use the
`intstd1`/`intstd2`/`intstd3` mapping remain supported.

`config/internal_stds.tsv` accepts 16S or 18S whole-genome standards. Store the
complete SSU rRNA gene reference in `full_SSU_sequence`; the legacy
`full_16S_sequence` heading remains accepted. For 18S standards, the workflow
automatically derives the same R1-plus-reverse-complemented-R2 sequence created
by the configured eukaryotic trimming and concatenation steps, then searches
both denoised 16S and 18S ASVs. `genome_len_bp` must remain the whole-genome
length and `rRNA_copy_number` the number of matching SSU copies per genome.

Internal-standard method tables use the configured IDs in their filenames. For
example, standards named `BP` and `DR` produce `asv_table_BP_recovery_ratio.tsv`
and `asv_table_mean_BP_and_DR_recovery_ratio.tsv`, so the correction represented
by every single-standard and combination output is explicit. The combined long
table similarly includes all configured IDs, for example
`<study>.BP_DR.ISD_corrected_long_data.tsv`.

The required starting-pool molarity file is named
`config/prok_and_euk_SSU_amplicon_molarities.tsv`. Updated workflows still
accept the previous `config/prok_and_euk_SSU_amplicon_concentrations.tsv` or
`config/bioanalyzer.tsv` when the new file is absent, allowing older study
folders to finish after a pipeline update.

Additional user-defined columns may be added to `config/samples.tsv`. They are
preserved in the generated QIIME metadata and are available as filters in the
HTML report; they do not alter read processing.

The cloned repository intentionally does not include a `config/` folder. Create
and download the study-specific setup package from the pipeline tutorial, then
place its complete `config/` folder in the repository before running Snakemake.

## Taxonomy databases

The executable classification steps are deliberately exposed as individual
Snakemake rules. The high-level dependency order is:

```text
SILVA or PR2 (selected independently)
  -> existing classifier: validate and reuse
  -> classifier URL: download -> validate + locked atomic publication
  -> no URL: RESCRIPt reference acquisition -> visible preparation rules
      SILVA: reverse transcribe -> cull -> length filter -> dereplicate
      PR2: normalize rank prefixes -> cull -> dereplicate
      -> primer extraction -> extracted-reference dereplication [amplicon mode]
      -> classifier training -> validation + locked atomic publication

canonical 16S ASVs
  -> selected SILVA classification -> SILVA taxonomy export --+
  -> selected PR2 classification -> export -> normalize -----+
                                                          |
                  TSV reconciliation (:plas, confidence >= 0.7)
                    -> resolved-taxonomy import
                    -> chloroplast/cyanobacteria/mitochondria/archaea splits

linked/unmerged 16S sensitivity run
  -> SILVA + PR2 classification -> five QIIME exports
  -> two explicit BIOM conversions -> supplementary TSV construction

concatenated 18S ASVs -> one PR2 classification -> normalized/exported taxonomy
```

The rationale, tradeoffs, and human-review status of major assisted changes are
recorded in the [hosted code-provenance ledger](https://github.com/Nwilliams96/515FY-926R-snakemake-NW-edits/blob/codex/code-provenance/CODE_PROVENANCE.md).
It is intentionally stored outside `main`, so ordinary pipeline clones do not
include the review document. The full sequence of repository revisions is also available in the
[GitHub commit history](https://github.com/Nwilliams96/515FY-926R-snakemake-NW-edits/commits/main/).

The configuration site offers three independent choices for both SILVA and PR2:

| Choice | Required fields | Pipeline behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Use existing databases | Existing trained classifier `.qza` path and declared release | Validate and reuse that exact file |
| Download pre-trained database | Classifier URL, destination directory, and declared release | Download, validate, and reuse the completed classifier |
| Train database with RESCRIPt | Reference release and destination directory | Acquire the reference and train through individual preparation rules |

Only fields for the selected method are emitted in the setup package. Existing
classifiers take precedence; otherwise a nonblank download URL selects the
download route, and an absent/blank URL selects training. Download failures do
not fall back silently to training. The default is SILVA 144 from the official
pre-trained SSU Ref NR99 uniform classifier, together with local RESCRIPt
preparation and training of PR2 5.1.1.

For the default 515Y/926R primers, the official SILVA preset selects the matching
V4–V5 classifier. Different primers select the known full-length preset instead.
Changing a preset updates its URL and checksum together; a custom URL is never
rewritten. Classifier release and region are declared by the user: QIIME artifact
validation checks format and type, not the biological provenance of an arbitrary
classifier. User-supplied models must match the intended region and QIIME
environment and come from a trusted source. A known download includes its checksum; a custom classifier URL
can omit a checksum but must still pass classifier-artifact validation.

The bundled
QIIME 2 2026.7 environment matches the version used to train that classifier.
The 2026.7 definition is used only when `qiime2version` is missing or blank.
Explicit YAML paths and installed environment names are respected, including
the older 2024.5 and 2025.7 definitions. Users must check that their selected
environment supports the pipeline commands and their supplied classifiers.
The bundled Linux definition is based on the official QIIME 2 2026.7 file but
omits Deblur and its obsolete SortMeRNA 2.0 dependency. This workflow uses
DADA2 exclusively, and excluding that unused dependency prevents Conda solver
failures without changing any pipeline analysis step.

SILVA 144 introduces a prokaryotic `Kingdom` rank and provides a consistent
seven-rank lineage from Domain through Genus. The formatted long table and HTML
report therefore include `Kingdom`. Taxonomy parsing is based on rank prefixes
(`d__`, `k__`, `p__`, and so on), so that new rank cannot shift Phylum, Class,
Order, Family, or Genus into the wrong columns. The official uniform QIIME 2
classifier stops at Genus. The workflow therefore follows classification with
an exact-match search against SILVA's official version 144 DADA2 species
reference when the declared SILVA release is 144. Other releases retain their
taxonomy without this augmentation, and the report explains that species
matching was skipped. An unambiguous exact match is accepted only when its genus agrees
with the QIIME 2 assignment. For example, an accepted match is appended as
`s__Vibrio cholerae`, and the formatted outputs contain `Vibrio` in `Genus` and
`Vibrio cholerae` in `Species`. Unmatched, ambiguous, or genus-conflicting ASVs
remain blank at Species. SILVA notes that these organism names are not curated,
so species calls should be treated as provisional. PR2-derived eukaryotic
species labels remain available independently.

The chloroplast/cyanobacterial subsetting step accepts both the older
`p__Cyanobacteria` label and SILVA 144's `p__Cyanobacteriota` label, preserving
those downstream tables across the database transition.

PR2 remains the primary eukaryotic classifier. The optional PR2 download route
expects an already-trained QIIME classifier, not a reference FASTA.
Use a classifier with the established nine-rank PR2 taxonomy. Whether acquired
by reuse, download, or local training, PR2 classification exports have their
rank prefixes normalized before downstream parsing. The small TSV helper
changes only taxonomy notation and preserves identifiers and confidence; the
unchanged confidence threshold still controls chloroplast reconciliation.

The 18S branch classifies each ASV once with PR2. The resulting artifact is
explicitly labelled PR2, passed through the established taxonomy-whitespace
normalization step, and then reused for the 18S bar plot, metazoan subsets, and
the final merged table. No separate SILVA-labelled 18S classification is
created.

Examples of the three methods (choose a single method per database):

```yaml
# Existing SILVA; this file is validated, never replaced by the workflow.
SILVAversion: "144"
use_preexisting_silva_database: true
silva_classifier: "/shared/classifiers/SILVA-144.qza"
```

```yaml
# Official SILVA download; the configuration site fills the complete URL
# and matching checksum for its known preset.
SILVAversion: "144"
use_preexisting_silva_database: false
SILVA_download_link: "https://www.arb-silva.de/fileadmin/silva_databases/release_144/QIIME2/2026.7/SSU/V4V5-515f-926r/uniform/SILVA_144_SSURef_NR99_uniform_classifier_V4V5-515f-926r.qza"
SILVA_download_md5: "f7757b01eb82e0ac78bf06427e410095"
silva_database_dir: "/shared/databases/classification/SILVA"
```

```yaml
# PR2 acquisition and local training; no PR2_download_link is supplied.
PR2version: "5.1.1"
use_preexisting_pr2_database: false
pr2_database_dir: "/shared/databases/classification/PR2"
```

PR2 also accepts `pr2_classifier`, `PR2_download_link`, and `PR2_download_md5` for
the equivalent reuse/download methods. Without a per-database directory, each
classifier falls back to `<database_dir>/classification/SILVA` or
`<database_dir>/classification/PR2`. Older reuse configurations without explicit
classifier paths retain their recognized legacy paths. The common `database_dir`
continues to hold BBsplit and supporting references, including the approximately
141 MB SILVA 144 exact-species reference. Reusing a classifier does not require
writing next to that classifier. BBsplit reuse is controlled only by
`use_preexisting_bbsplit_database`; if omitted, it defaults to `false`.

RESCRIPt training preserves the original modular rule order. SILVA references
include Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryota; the visible length-filter stage uses
minimum lengths of 1,200, 900, and 1,400 nt respectively. These are explicitly
selected and newly documented settings: the original length-filter helper is
missing from the imported repository, so they are not claimed to reproduce its
unknown historical contents. PR2 taxonomy is normalized to the established nine
ranks while preserving organelle labels such as `:plas`.

Both databases extract the configured primer region before training by default.
For an advanced full-length build, edit the YAML-only settings:

```yaml
silva_reference_mode: "full_length"  # default: "amplicon"
pr2_reference_mode: "full_length"    # default: "amplicon"
```

Full-length mode skips extraction and extracted-reference dereplication. These
settings affect local training only; they cannot change a downloaded classifier.
The installed RESCRIPt version must support the requested reference release.
The pinned environment currently cannot acquire SILVA 144 natively, so use the
official download or a compatible pre-existing classifier for that release.
The workflow checks this limitation before sample processing.

Classifier construction uses project-private intermediates under
`.snakemake/database-build/`. Locks serialize validation and atomic publication
to the selected destination. Compatible completed downloads and trained models
are reused; separate identities prevent different URLs, releases, recipes, or
training regions from silently sharing a classifier. Independent first-time
projects can duplicate private training work but cannot delete one another's
intermediates. Local readiness markers keep shared classifiers out of ordinary
Snakemake output cleanup.

BBsplit still uses the original SILVA 132/PR2 OSF reference FASTAs and the
existing indexing command. Its downloads now use the verified downloader with
exact destination paths, preventing absolute paths from being prefixed by the
project directory or renamed with `.1`, `.2`, and similar suffixes. Existing
misplaced copies are not removed automatically. This fixes downloading, not
concurrent first-time BBsplit indexing: prepare that shared index once before
starting several analyses against it.

## QIIME 2 environment selection

`qiime2version` accepts either a YAML environment definition or an installed
Conda environment name, for example:

```yaml
qiime2version: "../envs/rachis-qiime2-linux-64-2026.7.yml"
# Alternatively, select an already installed environment:
# qiime2version: "qiime2-2026.7"
```

With YAML, Snakemake reuses its completed matching hash-managed environment
under `conda_envs_dir`; it does not scan arbitrary installations for matching
packages. The existing YAML-based classifier-cache identity is unchanged.
With a name, Conda must be available to the Snakemake controller and the named
environment must already exist. The workflow resolves that exact prefix and
fingerprints its Conda/pip package inventory for locally trained classifier
cache identity. A package version/build change changes that identity. This
does not install, repair, or validate the environment against a YAML, nor does
it establish that a supplied classifier is compatible. The requested name,
resolved prefix, identity and selected recorded software versions appear in
the report's parameter summary.

For multiple users, prefer the same pinned YAML and shared `conda_envs_dir`
with appropriate permissions. Prepare environments once and avoid changing
them while jobs are running. Existing/downloaded SILVA and PR2 classifiers
must both match the selected QIIME 2/scikit-learn environment. Named inputs
that are missing or ambiguous fail early without creating an environment.

## DADA2 controls

The tutorial exposes separate DADA2 settings for the paired 16S path and the
concatenated, single-end 18S path. Generated configs contain a `dada2` block
covering expected-error filtering, quality truncation, paired-read overlap,
pooling, chimera detection, parent abundance, and error-model training reads.
The displayed presets reproduce the pipeline's historical settings. Configs
created before this block was introduced remain supported through matching
workflow defaults.

The workflow automatically runs a parallel linked-read sensitivity analysis;
users do not need to enable it in the config or tutorial. The canonical 16S
analysis still requires merging and is not changed by the supplemental pass.
A second DADA2 run retains linked forward/reverse pairs, and features unique to
that run are exported separately
as `<study>.unmerged_linked_16S.tsv` and
`<study>.unmerged_linked_16S_summary.tsv`. Both files are copied into the
project-named Results-Export folder. The linked supplement is intentionally
excluded from ordinary abundance, richness, report bar plots, and internal-
standard correction because linked pairs are not directly interchangeable
with merged ASVs and automatic combination could double-count features.

## USC CARC runner

`run_snakemake_USC_CARC_only.sh` requests one eight-core, 128 GB CARC job and
passes the Slurm CPU count to Snakemake. BBSplit, DADA2, and taxonomic
classification use up to eight threads. Snakemake also receives a 120 GB
memory budget, while the memory-heavy BBSplit and DADA2 rules declare realistic
per-job requirements so they are not run concurrently on the same allocation.
This USC-specific script is optional; other systems can use `run_snakemake.sh`
or provide allocation settings appropriate for their scheduler.

From the project directory, submit the CARC job with:

```bash
sbatch run_snakemake_USC_CARC_only.sh
```

The script reads `studyName` from `config/config.yml`, submits itself through
Slurm, and labels the queue entry and log files as `<studyName>`. Calling
the file with `sbatch` still works, but the log filename initially uses the
generic `pipeline` label because Slurm opens it before the script runs.
Before starting Snakemake, the CARC runner also detects config files whose
timestamps are ahead of the compute-node clock and resets only those timestamps.
This prevents clock-skew failures after moving ZIP packages between computers.
The runner gives every Slurm job a package cache under CARC's job-specific
`TMPDIR` while retaining completed rule environments in the configured shared
`conda_envs_dir`. This prevents simultaneous jobs on different nodes from
contending for Conda metadata in `~/.conda/pkgs` and avoids stale-file-handle
failures during environment creation.

The small per-sample BBTools trimming, repair, and fusion commands use a fixed
2 GB Java heap and declare 2.5 GB per job to Snakemake. This prevents concurrent
BBTools processes from each auto-claiming most of the node's available memory.

Sample identifiers are imported as text when the final QIIME metadata tables
are assembled, so numeric-only IDs and leading zeroes are retained correctly.
DADA2 export scripts also propagate failures from QIIME and BIOM commands rather
than allowing a failed piped command to appear successful.

Database families are prepared independently according to their selected
methods. BBSplit indexing and primer extraction use up to eight cores. QIIME's
naive-Bayes classifier-training action does not expose a worker-count option,
so final classifier training remains single-core.

## Run report

The final workflow target creates a self-contained report at:

```text
results/07-report/<studyName>.pipeline-report.html
```

The report records each classifier's declared release, preparation method,
path, storage directory, download URL when supplied, and effective training
region. It also summarizes the configuration, raw read pairs per sample, primer
trimming and BBsplit assignment loss, reads retained per sample after DADA2,
stage-specific DADA2 loss, sample-level quality control, domain composition,
16S/18S/chloroplast/mitochondrial assignments, unassigned sequences, abundant
taxa, the exact 16S and 18S molarity/read correction factors used during
merging, and—when enabled—the internal-standard results and figures. Horizontally
scrollable sample figures keep their y-axis scale visible, and report palettes
are chosen for colour-vision accessibility.

The taxonomy explorer provides a QIIME 2-style, 100%-stacked taxonomic bar plot
with one bar per sample. It can order and filter plotted samples by SampleID,
Condition, Latitude, Longitude, or Depth from `config/samples.tsv`, and display
every taxonomy level present in the formatted data, from Domain through Species,
including SILVA 144's Kingdom rank, PR2 ranks, and ProPortal ecotypes. It is embedded in the
self-contained report and works without an internet connection.

For convenient downloading, the workflow copies the report, formatted data,
and phylum- and order-level summaries into a top-level
`<projectName>-Results-Export/` folder. When internal standards are enabled, the
corrected ASV table is included there as well. Older configs without
`projectName` use `studyName` for the folder prefix.

When internal standards are enabled, the ordinary exported `long_data.tsv` is
also rebuilt without every ASV identified as an internal standard. The report
uses this same filtered table, preventing ISD reads from appearing in domain or
taxonomic-abundance plots. The separate `ISD_corrected_long_data.tsv` retains
the absolute-copy correction columns but likewise excludes the standard ASVs.
